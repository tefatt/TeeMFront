# youtube-search-promise

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

Easily search for videos on Youtube using their v3 API.

## Credit

Majority of this was actually written by [Max Gfeller](https://github.com/MaxGfeller) and his repo can be found [here](https://github.com/MaxGfeller/youtube-search) ðŸ‘€ I simply refactored it slightly to return a Promise ðŸ˜„ðŸŽ‰ I have not recreated his TypeScript implementation yet but look for that soon ðŸ“†

## Options

You can pass a lot of optional parameters as the second parameter, they are
documented [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list).

## Rate limiting

Google enforces a rate limit on the Youtube Data API. You will probably need to
register your application for a key and supply this key in the `opts`.

## JavaScript Usage

```javascript
var search = require("youtube-search-promise");

var opts = {
  maxResults: 10,
  key: "yourkey"
};

search("deadmau5", opts)
  .then(results => {
    console.log(results);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```
